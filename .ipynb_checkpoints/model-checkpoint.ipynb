       "'BTS: RM is reminded of Bon Voyage as he travels in Switzerland, gives glimpse of Chris Martin\\'s chair to fans. WatchAfter reaching his hotel in the city, RM revealed that his stay would be for four days and added that he would step out for dinner. As he sat at a roadside open-air restaurant, RM feasted on beer, burgers and fries. He said, \"I\\'m starving right now. I\\'m out to grab some food. It\\'s much quieter than I expected and feels like a rural town. I like the familiar atmosphere.\" RM attended Art Basel and explained on camera the details of the art fair. He also gave a glimpse as he had noodles and beer which was followed by soup noodles and wrap. Showing the pattern of a ping pong table, RM said, \"The table looks like our (BTS) symbol.\" He also spoke about the art pieces as he viewed them. After that, RM took a tram to visit the Foundation Beyeler, a museum. He later took a walk through the city. On his third day, RM visited the Kunstmuseum Basel, the Vitra Design Museum and the gallery. As he walked around, RM showed a chair to his fans and said, \"I have breaking news for you guys. Coldplay\\'s Chris Martin made a chair and it\\'s displayed in the Vitra Design Museum. If you see this Chris, give me a call. You\\'re amazing.\" RM next visited Lucerne and hiked to Mount Rigi. Recalling his previous visit to Lucerne, RM added, \"I remember the day of crossing that bridge and buying souvenirs.\" He was also reminded of Bon Voyage, a reality show featuring BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. Speaking to the camera, RM said, \"I rode the SSB train to Lucerne, rode a boat, rode the mountain train, walked down the track road, rode the cable cars, and now I\\'m on a boat planning to go ride the SSB again.\" RM\\'s travel in Switzerland ended with a visit to the Museum Tinguely. Next, RM flew to Paris to attend the Pinault Collection and to visit Musee d\\'Orsay. He then went to Centre Georges-Pompidou and Orsay Museum. RM\\'s vlog ended with him enjoying a Korean meal and then heading back to Seoul.'"

and &#39;Hype Boy&#39; become hits, but also led to the cover dance craze, winning both the Rookie Award and the Grand Prize at the year-end awards ceremony  He boasted an unrivaled presence and charm \\n\\nNewJeans&#39; achievement:\\n\\nIn particular, it showed the &#39;retro&#39; concept properly  With styling and cover images reminiscent of the 1990s and early 2000s, they instantly caught the eye, establishing themselves as a girl group with a unique concept  Here, while focusing on the narrative of &#39;relationship&#39;, the music video with an interesting story received a lot of attention  The chorus that is easy to sing along with the lyrics that resonate with, the addictive melody, and the attractive choreography were also points  As a result, content such as challenges, cover songs, and cover dances naturally increased &nbsp;\\n\\nDitto:\\n\\nThe pre-released song &#39;Ditto&#39; attracted attention as soon as it was released with Park Ji Hu and Choi Hyun Wook&#39;s appearances and the retro sensibility of the video  In this way, New Jeans has already captured not only the topic but also the music charts in a short period of time  If last summer was refreshing NewJeans, this hip-hop R&amp;B &#39;OMG&#39; is expected to show a hip yet dreamy NewJeans \\n\\nNewJeans:\\n\\nThe strengths of NewJeans, such as the retro concept to believe in and watch, the narrative music video that is tightly packed with the keyword &#39;relationship&#39;, the content that makes you more immersed, the beautiful visuals of the members, the ability to blend these concepts perfectly, and the addictive yet attractive song  The number of pre-orders for NewJeans&#39; &#39;OMG&#39; this time exceeded 800,000 copies, surpassing the pre-order amount of the debut album and the total sales volume  The pre-released song &#39;Ditto&#39; took first place on various music charts upon its release, and is still receiving a lot of love \\n_ZAgIHmHLdcHere are five reasons why this song and MV had us gripping our seats:-&nbsp;\\n\\nSong\\n\\nThe title song &#39;OMG&#39;, which was released following the pre-release song released at the end of the year, is a bouncy and exciting hip-hop R&amp;B song that mixes UK garage rhythm and trap rhythm based on hip-hop drum source and percussion  In particular, the fact that the song was conceived during the production of the debut album also arouses interest  Member Hanni participated in writing the lyrics, and one can feel another charm of NewJeans by expressing their unique and trendy tone in various styles \\n\\nConcept&nbsp;\\n\\nNewJeans have made a name for themselves from their debut time as one of the most unique K-Pop groups to exist as they break the stereotypes and the mold presented to them by the predecessors and rather, pave a new way of creating music as well as the MV  The MV is set in a mental facility where the five members express their issues and who they see themselves as  While it can seem quirky and funny, it is actually an inside view on how intense feelings can alter you as a person &nbsp;\\n\\nThe members&nbsp;\\n\\nIn the MV, each member has a different problem  Hanni thinks she is Siri, iPhone&rsquo;s built-in, voice controlled personal assistant, Danielle was found laughing at a TV with static but she is actually the person who thinks they are being controlled and tries to make the members remember that they are, in fact, NewJeans  It seems like Hyein has &lsquo;main character syndrome&rsquo; where she takes the role of the main character in her favorite fairy tales like Cinderella, Matchstick girl and Snow White while Haerin thinks she is a cat and is seen in many scenes, behaving like one  But the most twisted one is Minji&rsquo;s, who pretends to be a doctor taking all the other members to the facility while she, herself, suffers through issues &nbsp;\\n\\nThe message&nbsp;\\n\\nThe song talks about being lovesick and how those intense feelings make one go crazy and that is what shows in the MV as well  The idea of being meta in the MV also adds a nice flair to it  The idea of being in a relationship and expressing the struggles of being in one in this day and age is amazingly executed &nbsp;\\n\\nReferences&nbsp;\\n\\nThe MV is packed with references  First, the choreography for OMG was initially shown to the viewers in Ditto and other scenes from that MV also makes its way like the gray cat represents Haerin  Kim Joo Hun of Big Mouth fame makes an appearance as the doctor who eventually becomes overwhelmed with all the stories he heard but the end scene is truly the cherry on top when a girl is shown writing hate comments about NewJeans and Minji appears as the doctor, taking her away &nbsp;\\n\\nALSO READ: BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Jisoo to make her long awaited solo debut?

       " {\"Jack In The Box Review: BTS’ J-Hope’s soul bearing attempt is soft in the feels but rough around the edgesBTS member J-Hope has always been an ace, this time around- even more so  How?Jung Hoseok, born on February 18, 1994 is a South Korean rapper, singer, dancer, songwriter, record producer and the absolute source of everything bright and hopeful for his fellow members of the iconic septet BTS as well as their unimaginably large throng of fans, ARMYs spread around the world  But that’s all the information we already know of Making his first full length album release and being the first from his group to officially do so, J-Hope dropped ‘Jack In The Box’ on July 15  A couple of weeks since its release and the album has broken multiple records, understandably so  Today, we take a look at the many reasons why it works with a track by track breakdown of this 10-song record Intro: It is unbelievable if any other start to the album could be as perfect as this one, as it very obviously traces back to the roots of what being J-Hope stands for  Taking a page from the tale of ‘Pandora’s Box’ where ‘hope’ is the last remaining item, a woman’s voice reads out the story  It is genius and very reflective of the contents of the album Pandora’s Box: Right on cue, this track meets the audiences as a scroll from the past  J-Hope’s existence is painted over his will to go back to his basics to open his own box that reveals a token his moniker MORE: The pre-release single saw J-Hope taking on a challenging and effective peep into his journey as an artist and a thirst for even ‘MORE’  With old school hip-hop beats he admits to self-learning and his readiness to fail in the process of creating art STOP: The Korean name for the song translates to ‘There Are No Bad People In The World’ and it is depictive of J-Hope’s beliefs  A world riddled with sad happenings is still a world full of people who never wish to be bad  The artist’s humane tendencies rumble through the softer tones of the track where asks people to stop fighting, it’s more hopeful than decisive = (Equal Sign): The song is deep rooted into J-Hope’s understanding of people  He desires an equal stature and belts out the many reasons why he thinks it makes the perfect sense  “Hate'll paralyze your mind/ Gotta see the other side”, hopeful indeed Music Box : Reflection: It is the perfect breather to go over the class change in style of music that J-Hope has presented so far  The audio is that of an eerie music playing from the toy that the album’s art is based on What if…: The hip-hop industry’a attention was brought to this track particularly because of the presence of R  Diggs and R  Jones from the legendary Wu-Tang Clan in the credits  Interestingly J-Hope also has their song ‘Shimmy Shimmy Ya’ sampled for ‘What if…’  Lyrically, it’s a sharp breakage of J-Hope’s many fears  He talks to his own self as two different entities questioning the other’s existence and his desperation to be in the game Safety Zone: The most surprising one on the album, J-Hope once again lays himself bare with his inner thoughts of having no home to call his own while also having the privilege of being a star  In a life that’s a paradox, he wonders if there really is any ‘Safety Zone’ of his own Future: Much like the title, the artist raps of his many wants and haves  He counts the numerous steps that took to be where he is today and looks at the scary future lying ahead of him  It seems to be an almost acceptance of the struggles that he has so far chanted over the course of the album Arson: The title track for ‘Jack In The Box’, J-Hope recounts the many aspects of being himself and letting go of any inhibitions by burning them as a celebration of his glory  While the fire he lit to keep himself going has turned to an ‘Arson’, he wonders if he should keep going or stop Ahead of his monumental performance at the Lollapalooza music festival, we walked with J-Hope, through his many facades that he has to keep up for survival and his real self that wants nothing but to reveal itself  Breaking away from the expectations of a K-pop idol and putting himself to a test, J-Hope has hit quite the challenge for himself with this release  ‘Jack In The Box’ is brave and nerve-wracking but applaud worthy at the same time Join the biggest community of K-Pop fans live on Pinkvilla Rooms to get one step closer to your favourite K-Celebs!

He has frequently spoken up about his battles with depression, social anxiety, and OCD while offering condolence to his fans worldwide who feel alone in their mental battles \\n\\nThe BTS member opened up about his mental struggles back in 2016 when he released Agust D, his first mixtape  In that mixtape, he built an alter-ego who resisted all societal expectations but had a vulnerability that allowed him to rift the topic of mental health \\n\\nIn Agust D, SUGA raps,\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n&quot;On the other side of the famous idol rapper\\n\\nStands my weak self, it&rsquo;s a bit dangerous\\n\\nDepression, OCD\\n\\nThey keep coming back again from time to time &quot;\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nOnce again, in May 2021, in an interview with Rolling Stone, SUGA explained his mental health as cold weather wherein negative emotions come and go  He added that people must be encouraged to share their mental health struggles, rather than silently suffering and keeping it to themselves \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThis BTS member has often used music and songs like The Last to look introspectively and address the depression and anxiety that he faces \\n\\nHe has also openly spoken about mental health disorders during many interviews  In one such interview, Suga stated, &quot;loneliness and anxiety stay forever  How you choose to make peace with them needs a lifetime of contemplation &quot;\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nRM (BTS)\\nBTS members have never shied away from openly speaking about rough and sensitive issues that the youths of today face \\n\\nSo, when RM fans questioned him about his well-being - when he hosted a live broadcast to celebrate his 27th birthday on 12 September - he replied, &quot;every day is a fight to not lose to depression and not giving up &quot;\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nWe, as his fans and followers, are pleased to see that he spoke about his mental well-being and is making time for activities, like cleaning his room, exercising, and watering plants, that support his physical as well as mental health \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nBae Suzy (Miss A)\\nBae Suzy has been in the public eye ever since the debut of Miss A in 2010  She was merely 15 years old when she was thrust into fame  While being an actor and K-pop idol got her stardom, she was beyond stressed and battled depression during the initial years of her career \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nJuggling between Miss A&#39;s promotions and her acting projects, Suzy was pushed to the brink and even burst into tears in front of her close friend  She spoke about her mental health struggles during a talk show, Healing Camp, on SBS  She even blatantly called out to people who forgot that she was merely a child \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe former member of Miss A appears to be doing considerably better and also released an English number, Cape, which is the perspective of being someone&#39;s aid as they steer through their mental health issues \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nKang Daniel\\nKang Daniel, the former member of Wanna One, has always been honest about his battles with mental illness  Not only has he been vocal about it, but he even based an entire album, Yellow, around this subject  This album included songs like Paranoia and Antidote and was released in April 2021  The songs were a reference to the three-month-long break that he took in November 2019 to focus on his mental well-being after dealing with anxiety, depression, and panic disorders  Fortunately, this much-needed break seemed to help him with how he felt about himself and the industry (in general), and he definitely returned feeling much stronger and better!\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIn an interview with NME, Kang Daniel stated,\\n\\n&quot;I don&rsquo;t think I have changed, but I feel like there has been a change  I still read bad comments, but because I was able to overcome them once, I can just deal with them now  There is a certain way to do that, and I trust myself and the people around me to help me  There are good days and bad days, but there is always a reason to live  There are good things about life, and that is what I look for now &quot;\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nJeongyeon (Twice)\\nJYP Entertainment announced in August 2021 that Twice&#39;s Jeongyeon would take her second break owing to psychological anxiety and panic disorder  The company further added that while she did perform at the 30th Seoul Music Awards (at the end of January) with her entire group, both parties have mutually decided to prioritize her mental health  Jeongyeon also took to Bubble, a messaging app, to assure her fans and followers that she would return feeling better and healthier \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nJae (Day6)\\nJae, Day6&#39;s member, had a near-death experience in 2020 when he suffered a panic attack while driving  He thought he could live through his anxiety and sweep things under the rug  That was until things reached a critical point  Since then, Jae has taken actions, such as medication, to help with his mental condition  Plus, he is also actively raising awareness about mental health illness and toxic positivity \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nS Coups (SEVENTEEN)\\nUndoubtedly, K-pop idols are stressed owing to the high expectations of their viewers and fans  However, nobody compares when it comes to the leaders of the respective bands and groups  The leader of the band, SEVENTEEN, S Coups is one such example  He had to take a pause from band activities when the symptoms of his anxiety did not allow him to participate in the world tour of Ode To You \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHe, too, did not shy away from speaking about it  In a behind-the-scenes series, titled Hit The Road, S Coups spoke about his emotions, saying that he tried to ride out but ultimately decided to take a break  He further stated that although performing brought him happiness, he did not want things to change due to his mental health issues \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nLee Ji-Eun, a-k-a IU\\nIU is undoubtedly one of the cutest and most well-known female K-pop idols  She was only a teenager when she debuted as a K-pop soloist (without having other people or members to lean on as in bands)  However, not only did she eventually find her footing in the Korean industry, she went on to become one of the most immensely successful artists \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nWhat fans may not is that this popular Palette singer suffered from Bulimia Nervosa, a potentially life-threatening and harmful eating disorder, in the earlier days of her career  This also unconsciously manifested as anxiety about her weight  Moreover, she even had to follow an extreme diet (dubbed the IU diet) to lose weight (as per Korean beauty standards) for an acting project \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAlthough despite everything, she did not back down and spoke about her experiences in 2014 at SBS&#39; Healing Camp  She stated that she sought help for her anxiety issue and Bulimia  Furthermore, IU also highlighted the fact of how much stress is faced by all the K-pop idols, emotionally referring to the loss of one of her dear friends as they took their own life \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIn 2018, during her speech at the Golden Disc&nbsp;Awards, she urged her fellow artists to prioritize themselves and openly and honestly express their emotions - before comforting their fans (as the old adage goes, &quot;help yourselves so that you can help others &quot;)\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nJonghyun (SHINee)\\nThough it seems almost impossible to bring up his name without referring to his death (he took his own life after struggling with depression) in 2017, SHINee&#39;s vocalist Kim Jonghyun was one of the very first K-pop idols and the loudest voices to speak up about mental health \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nJonghyun used his fame and Korean platform to shed light on significant issues and taboos surrounding mental health  He literally had done it all - from openly handling queries about mental health on Blue Night, his radio show, to supporting a trans fan who bravely opened up about their struggles \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nMoreover, this K-pop idol even spoke up about his own depression in the songs, Let Me Out (which he himself penned down) and A Gloomy Clock by IU (featuring Jonghyun) \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nKim Hyun-ah, a-k-a HyunA\\nIn 2016, HyunA was hospitalized and diagnosed with panic disorders and depression  It took a year for Kim, the former 4Minute band member, to come to terms with her mental condition \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nKim Hyun-ah, a-k-a HyunA, revealed in a letter that she had actually wanted to keep her mental health illness a secret, but she could not hide it further \\n\\nShe even wrote, &ldquo;I am bravely going to keep trying to be well, but I think people can not be perfect  I think it is not too late  I am going to love myself and take care of myself  I am going to be courageous and honest like I am now &rdquo;\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHani (EXID)\\nIt has been quite a while since Hani has been speaking up about her interest in becoming a psychotherapist post her career as a K-pop idol \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHaving dealt with her own mental health struggles during her career, Hani expressed her wish to work specifically with K-Pop idols as she knows how tough their lives can be \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nKwon Mina (AOA)\\nIn 2020, there were rumors that the former AOA member Kwon Mina was bullied by Jimin, their band&rsquo;s leader, while other members stayed silent \\n\\nIn July 2021, one year after these allegations surfaced, it was reported that she had attempted to take her own life \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAfter regaining consciousness, Mina announced her plans to take serious legal action against the bullying rumors spread by netizens  In September 2021, Dispatch, the Korean news outlet, released messages between the AOA band members, including Jimin and Kwon, in which they had discussed the bullying issue \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nTaeyeon (Girls&rsquo; Generation)\\nFollowing the death of her close friends Jonghyun and Sulli, several of her fans were concerned about her mental health condition  Back in June 2019, during an Instagram question-and-answer session, Taeyeon got candid when someone rudely asked her if she had bipolar disorder and ended it with a &quot;tsk tsk &quot;\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nShe revealed that she was suffering from depression and was taking medicine and working hard to get better  She also stated that she seems most vulnerable and at her worst after she is done with her touring and concerts and is left feeling alone without being surrounded by many people  Further, she commented, &quot;whether it is bipolar disorder or depression, do not just &quot;tsk tsk&quot; people and look at them negatively  They are all patients who are sick and in pain &quot;\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHer response was hugely appreciated and appropriately critical  However, since then she has not spoken much about her mental health condition \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nJay B (Got7)\\nIn March 2021, in an interview with ARENA Magazine, the former Got7 member Jay B announced that he had been diagnosed with clinical depression which actually came to him as a surprise  He stated, &quot;I thought I was just mentally weaker than other people &quot;\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIn May 2021, in an interview with Allure, he once again spoke candidly about his anxiety and depression  He further shared, &quot;for more than 3-4 years, I have felt extreme pressure and burden as an artist, but instead of taking medication, I often hid those feelings away &rdquo;\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThankfully, Jay B started taking therapy and medication after his diagnosis  he even shared that he is getting better after getting the proper help  After his experience, he has frequently encouraged his fans and followers to confidently talk about these kinds of problems and to seek professional help, if needed, for their own mental well-being  He also acknowledged the fact that there is no shame in prioritizing yourself and taking care of your mental health \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nRenjun (NCT)\\nNCT&#39;s Renjun is one of the most outspoken members, especially when it comes to talking about mental health illnesses and disorders  Although he has never been specific about what he is battling, Renjun has often talked about how he has had a hard time and learned art therapy from a teacher, which proved to be incredibly beneficial for him \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHe took to Twitter to express himself and stated,\\n\\n&quot;There was a point where I really had a hard time, but I met a good teacher  I draw, it&#39;s called art therapy, it&#39;s healing your mind through drawing, and I met a teacher who helps people who have hard times, they became a great help in my life  What is hard is that I am an adult encountering society and looking for a way to handle it, but since I&#39;m young and inexperienced  It&#39;s as if I put my hand here, and it hurts like hell, but (there is no) way  So when I was like that, the teacher guided me well, and I became the person that I am today with the thoughts I have right now &quot;\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nWendy (Red Velvet)\\nIn an episode of Mysterious Record Shop, Red Velvet&#39;s Wendy spoke up about obtaining psychological help for the mental difficulties that she had been facing \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nShe stated,\\n\\n&quot;When we are promoting, we do not have a break  I don&rsquo;t think I should express my hardships  I did not know it myself because I was hiding all these things &rdquo;\\n\\nFurthermore, Wendy said,\\n\\n&quot;I was more apprehensive about others and did not focus and prioritize my own needs  However, I finally plucked the courage to go for counseling with a psychologist because I was biting my tail and biting my tail&rdquo; \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHan (Stray Kids)\\nStray Kids&#39; member Han is not the only band member to have discussed having trouble with his mental health  He has also spoken about having social anxiety in certain situations \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIn December 2019, JYP Entertainment had also announced that Han would be taking a break from some fan signs due to intermittent psychological anxiety  Moreover, he also used to breaks during some of the promotional events of the band owing to his anxiety \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThankfully, his fans quickly sent their support and showered him with their love at the time  Also, he revealed that his anxiety disorder seems to be more stable nowadays \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nf(x) Sulli\\nSulli was a highly popular former member of the South Korean pop girl group f(x)  Sully was outspoken by nature with overtly sexual tones and was often caught in disfavor amongst many Koreans  She was even cyberbullied for her persona, with many followers leaving numerous negative comments on her social media \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nShe had struggled with social phobia, panic disorder, and depression before she died on October 2019 \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nGoo Hara (Kara)\\nKara&#39;s Goo Hara and Sulli were very close friends, and only a month after her death, news broke about Goo&rsquo;s death  Goo Hara, a former member of the girl group Kara, suffered grave bouts of cyberbullying and online criticism because of her sex video scandal with Choi Jong-bum  Goo Hara&#39;s former boyfriend, Choi, was a hairdresser and had assaulted her, threatening to release a sex video of the two  Though Choi was ultimately put into jail, things went much worse for Goo Hara as she was brutally trolled and harassed on social media \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nGoo Hara had released a musical single, and only a week later came the news of her shocking death, which took her fans by utmost surprise \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nLeeteuk (Super Junior)\\nLeeteuk, a member of the K-pop band Super Junior, is well-known for his outspoken persona and variety of capabilities  Leeteuk has often spoken that he is battling depression \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nNot only did he reveal his struggle with mental illness, he even expressed his painful family background  He revealed how his father murdered his frail grandparents and took his own life, leaving him with a debt of five billion dollars ($5,835) that he had to work off \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nKim Heechul (Super Junior)\\nHeechul is yet another member of the K-pop group Super Junior who is vastly known for his outspoken and hilarious persona on South Korean variety shows, including Knowing Bros (2015 - present) \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHowever, behind all those laughs is a person struggling with depression  Heechul was a close friend of Jonghyun and Sulli  After the death of Kara&#39;s Goo Hara, he privatized his Instagram account to deal with the loss  As per the reports, he also shut himself down for about three months when Hankyung, a former Super Junior member, left the group \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nCha In-ha\\nCha In-ha, aged 27, was a young newbie K-pop actor who passed in December 2019  He made his debut in 2017 with Temperature of Love, a Korean TV drama  He was starring in Love with Flaws at the time of his death \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAs his death followed the deaths of two other K-pop idols - Goo Hara and Sulli - many fans and followers started raising apprehensions about copycat suicides  A slightly bizarre fact is that neither did he leave a will or a message nor did his family request an autopsy  It was assumed that he took his own life after struggling with mental health issues \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nYeonwoo (Momoland)\\nYeonwoo had previously taken a break from the promotions of the girl group Momoland  This gap even resulted in sparking rumors that she was leaving the group \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHowever, the agency waved away all such rumors and claimed that Yeonwoo was getting treatment for her mental condition of panic disorder  Ultimately, she started to feel better, left her girl group, and started her solo career as a K-pop actress \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nConclusion\\nBeing a celebrity with global influence is never easy  Behind the curtains, our beloved K-pop idols often go through a lot of pressure in the course of their careers  And at times, navigating life constantly dealing with mental health issues can become overwhelming and tough \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nSo, rather than nonchalantly dusting off this rather sensitive issue, these K-pop idols openly spoke up about their mental health disorders and their impacts  Apart from these K-pop idols, even G-Dragon and MONSTA X&#39;s Joohooney have also been open about their mental health issues and struggles \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHopefully, you will support your favorite K-pop artists and also take their advice to reach out for help if and when you need it \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIf you need support or know someone who is struggling, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist or speak to someone about it  There are multiple helplines available for the same \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nOnce again, please remember that you are not alone!\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nMust Read:&nbsp;Top 10 K-pop songs that will make you feel BEAUTIFUL': 74.63720538720521},\n",

       " {'BTS’ SUGA’s profile merges with Agust D, ARMYs speculate solo album to follow after J-Hope’s ‘Jack In The Box’We can almost smell the comeback announcement! The boys of BTS have set forth their chapter 2 and it has been a rollercoaster ride so far  With impressive tattoo reveals and solo debuts planned, the BTS ARMY is in for a year full of exciting content and especially more music  Adding to the anticipation, on July 7, member SUGA’s two official profiles under the names SUGA and his alias Agust D happened to merge on Apple Music Soon, fans also noted that the bio under his solo profile SUGA was also changed to mention his features on songs by Halsey and PSY as well as gives a nod to his ‘lyrical solo efforts’ with the albums ‘Agust D’ and ‘D-2’, his two mixtapes that were released as his alias Agust D Apple Music is currently listing all #AgustD tracks &amp; albums under #SUGA profile  My profile bio on Apple Music has been updated too : https://t co/YAS15wYNa4Hm?https://twitter com/rappersvga/status/1544884069971873792?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwThis caused a stir in the ARMY world as the two albums were also shifted to be made available under the name SUGA while the Agust D profile was nowhere to be found for some time  While the profile itself returned, the albums were notably still under the name of SUGA  This confusion has made fans speculate that a new solo album from SUGA will be released soon They come with receipts as the last time a change in the Agust D profile was when the image was changed to his poster of ‘D-2’ even before its release  What followed was the album drop that fans welcomed with wide arms  Moreover, the BTS members have already revealed that solo music for all seven of them is in the works  We think following the release of J-Hope’s ‘Jack In The Box’ on July 15, we can expect to be treated with another announcement soon after Is this the start of another announcement or a mere mistake?

Reflecting on how his life has changed since debuting with the Bangtan Boys in 2013, RM looked back at their initial music and compared to their newer ones, he said: “[This music] was heartfelt at the time, but trends change quickly, and I realized that my own ear [for music] has changed quite a bit  Will ‘Butter‘ and ‘Permission to Dance‘ also sound outdated once time has passed? Because we live within trends, I’ve gotten used to [going along with what’s fashionable at the time], but I don’t think I should live like that  I’m not sure what to do, but I want to produce something ‘long-lasting’ and ‘timeless ’ Now that it’s been been nearly nine years since I debuted as BTS, I’ve started thinking about that a lot ”RM also shared: “In the past, I used to have a lot of rules in my head, like ‘You need to do this or that,’ and I was caught up in the idea of wanting to show off something amazing, such as an impressive technique  These days, I focus on trying to create a certain texture that I want to convey in an abstract way  I’ve developed the ability to think in multisensory dimensions, such as vision or touch  When you create music, there are different elements like lyrics, melody, beat, and voice, and my approach is to look at the sum of all these things together to see if they express what I originally wanted to convey ”Considering BTS’ popularity and representing South Korea in front of a global audience, the idol was asked if the responsibility is ever limits the band artistically or while making music  RM responded: “At times, representing the nation feels great, and at other times, it can be a lot of pressure  What’s certain is that this role isn’t something we achieved because we sought it out, and it’s not something that goes away just because you want it to  I think it’s my fate to accept it as my calling and do a good job at what I can  If I had to put it into words, I’d say that I’d like to live my life while thinking, ‘This kind of life is fun too '”ALSO READ: Will you debut as the eighth member of BTS?\": 14.96661054994388},\n",

1 Night&rsquo;, &lsquo;New Journey to the West&rsquo;, &lsquo;Three Meals a Day&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; as well as its earlier spin-off show &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo;, is said to be returning for this season of &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; \\n\\nSeojin&rsquo;s premiere date\\n\\nEarlier today, it was reported by Korean media outlets that the new restaurant variety show is in its last phase of post-production  They are said to be eyeing an early February date for the broadcast  While nothing has been confirmed, it is reported that the show will air every Friday  While the two seasons of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; spanned over 9 and 11 episodes each, &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; had 12 episodes  A similar timeline is expected for &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; \\n\\nCast for Seojin&rsquo;s\\n\\nIt was confirmed that the cast lineup for &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; would include actor Lee Seo Jin, actress Jung Yu Mi, best friends and former &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; cast mates Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik  This time, however, they will be joined by another member of the famed Wooga Squad  BTS&rsquo; V has reportedly been roped in to join the cast for this spin-off show  With such a sparkling team at its disposal, &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; may as well become one of the biggest and most anticipated variety show releases of the year \\n\\nTake a look at the reasons why &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; is set on the path to success \\n\\nThe concept of Seojin&rsquo;s\\n\\nIt is known that unlike &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; which looked to promote Korean dishes through its program, this spin-off will also include lighter options for the global audience  Earlier, it was reported that the show has been shot in Mexico this season following the international filming locations of Indonesia and Spain for &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo;, followed by a domestic shoot in Jeonnam in 2020 for &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; \\n\\nNa PD&rsquo;s charm\\n\\nA popular name in the industry, Na Young Seok PD is known to be level-headed and strict when it comes to conducting variety shows  He is hardly ever swayed by the charm of the cast before him and sticks to rules  At the same time, he creates amazingly enjoyable shows which receive great viewership ratings by adding fun segments, dire situations and unbelievable twists  &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; is expected to bring his magic to the table \\n\\nPopular participants\\n\\nActor Lee Seo Jin who has been present for both the seasons of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; and one season of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; is familiar with the overarching concept  It was observed that he was of great help during those shows and brings experience as well as leadership to the show  Turning it to focus on him after Youn Yuh Jung&rsquo;s decision to depart may become a successful change if he manages to pull off the role  Much like Lee Seo Jin, Jung Yu Mi has also been a part of the earlier three seasons and brings her own understanding to the show &nbsp;\\n\\nActors Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik are best friends off-camera and jokesters on camera  They have a tried and tested chemistry which was previously seen in &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo;, &lsquo;Summer Vacation&rsquo;, &lsquo;Parasite&rsquo; and &lsquo;IN THE SOOP: Friendcation&rsquo;  This time the two will be joined by BTS member V who was seen leaving for Mexico as well as spotted alongside Park Seo Joon during a restaurant visit there  The K-pop icon confirmed his participation in the show by sharing a photo from the shoot where he could be seen staring at the bright moon with a shirt with actor Lee Seo Jin&rsquo;s caricature \\nV for Victory\\n\\nWhile BTS member V is known to not have a lot of skills in cooking, as previously seen during the group&rsquo;s activities including his memorable &lsquo;squirrel plate&rsquo; incident in &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;, he brings charm wherever he goes  A certified &lsquo;social butterfly&rsquo; his synergy with the other cast members will be looked out for  He goes into &lsquo;maknae mode&rsquo;

Jimin are featured in black outfits  The poster depicts the fierce gazes and sleek looks of both the K-pop idols along with mentioning the release date of the song  This poster is in itself a vibe as it shows enchanting blue lighting around both the K-pop idols &nbsp;\\n\\nFans were quick to react in the comments section with encouragement and love  One user mentioned that they missed Taeyang these years and it is a much-awaited song  While the other user tweeted that Jimin&rsquo;s dream of working with his inspiration finally came true  BTS fans are also ecstatic to make &rsquo;VIBE&#39; the most successful song worldwide  They also shared their streaming goals for this song on Spotify, YouTube and other such platforms &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\nTHEBLACKLABEL also tweeted that the &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; would be released on Taeyang&rsquo;s YouTube channel on 13 January 2023 at 2:00 PM Korean Standard Time  People can also soon order their &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; merch including logo caps, long-sleeved t-shirts, and short-sleeved t-shirts &nbsp;\\nhttps://twitter com/THEBLACKLABEL/status/1612313341245931523Here are 5 reasons VIBE could be the next viral song\\n\\n1  Taeyang&rsquo;s first new song in six years as a solo artist\\n\\nThe release of the song &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; will mark Taeyang&rsquo;s first new release as a solo artist in about six years  His last work as a solo artist was a record named &lsquo;White Night&rsquo; which was released in 2017  The record included two new singles, &lsquo;Tonight&rsquo; and &lsquo;Darling&rsquo;  Additionally, this new song will also be released under his new label THEBLACKLABEL after the expiration of his contract with YG Entertainment  However, it is an affiliate company of YG Entertainment, which producer Teddy heads \\n\\nHowever, for Jimin, the song will mark his first venture into solo music much like the other BTS members who are currently focusing on their solo careers  Earlier J-Hope debuted as a soloist in 2022 with the album &lsquo;Jack In The Box&rsquo; and Jin debuted with his solo single &lsquo;The Astronaut&rsquo; in October 2022  After that, RM released his solo album &lsquo;Indigo&rsquo; in December 2022 and Jungkook also released his solo song &lsquo;Dreamers&rsquo; as an official soundtrack for FIFA World Cup 2022 \\n\\n2  Taeyang and Jimin&rsquo;s aesthetics on the poster\\n\\nOn January 4 2023, THEBLACKLABEL made an official announcement through Taeyang&#39;s social media accounts, including both the release date and title of the song  Taeyang also shared an additional solo teaser of the song which will feature Jimin, in a monochromatic headshot style  A second teaser revealed Taeyang in a sleek and chiselled look \\n\\nThe poster released shows the perfect mixture of groove and hip-hop with both the idols in sleek hairstyles and black outfits  Even before the official announcement of &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; was made, fans were already suspicious about this collaboration  When Taeyang posted some behind-the-scenes pictures from the recording studio with another person  Fans were quick to identify the musician as Jimin and as J-Hope liked the picture, it further fueled the collaboration rumours \\nhttps://twitter com/THEBLACKLABEL/status/16127059270224977933  Fans&#39; reaction to the teaser\\n\\nTHEBLACKLABEL, Taeyang&rsquo;s agency also confirmed the collaboration of the two K-pop idols by sharing the first teaser of the song  Jimin and Taeyang absolutely depict a different vibe in this teaser with powerful synergy and fierce gazes  The teaser itself has garnered huge attention from fans on a global scale  It will undoubtedly become a viral song \\n\\nEarlier fans went into a frenzy as it was announced that BIGBANG&rsquo;s Taeyang will be collaborating with BTS&rsquo; Jimin  BTS&#39; official account made this announcement on Twitter along with sharing an official poster featuring both Taeyang and Jimin in red and black outfits \\n\\nFans are increasingly happy for Jimin as he is collaborating with his musical inspiration  One user tweeted that the dream did come true for Jimin and that he is an inspiration to millions of other people &nbsp;\\n\\n4  Combined abilities of Taeyang and Jimin\\n\\nThe song combines the musical abilities of both Jimin from BTS and Taeyang from BIGBANG  Both these K-pop idols are well-liked by the audience because of their talents and looks  Taeyang&rsquo;s groovy music is expected to harmoniously melt with the delicate and unique vocals of Jimin, which will certainly make this song a huge success \\n\\nThis collaboration for the song &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; is also extremely special for Jimin since he has always admired Taeyang  When Jimin was asked in an interview about the singer that he most admired and respected, he answered, &quot;Taeyang sunbaenim (senior) &quot;\\n\\n5  Song&rsquo;s release on 13 January 2023\\n\\nThe release date of the &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; is January 13, 2:00 PM KST, which is interesting as Jimin&rsquo;s birth date is October 13 while BTS debuted as a K-pop group in 2013  Netizens were quick to make the connection that 13 might be a lucky number for Jimin  His fans took to Twitter to express their excitement over the news  One user mentioned that this BTS singer is so cool while the other one mentions that two members of the two most popular K-Pop groups are coming together so everyone should come together to make it successful \\n\\nPreviously, Jimin from BTS also released OST &lsquo;With You&rsquo; in collaboration with the singer Ha Sung Woon for the Korean drama Our Blues  The song received a huge response from fans around the world with it ranking high on Billboard&rsquo;s Hot Trending Songs chart \\n\\nJimin made his debut with BTS in 2013 along with six other members Jungkook, RM, V, Jin, J-Hope, and SUGA  Earlier, he also released three other solo tracks along with BTS that included &lsquo;Filter&rsquo;, &lsquo;Serendipity&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Lie&rsquo;  On the other hand, Taeyang made his debut with BIGBANG in 2006 with Daesung, T O P , G-Dragon, and former member Seungri  The group made their increasingly awaited comeback in April 2022 after four long years with the track &lsquo;Still Life&rsquo;

and the second part of this edition had the fans of the group rolling on the floor with laughter and shedding tears at the same time  Here are the highlights from the episode as well as why the BTS ARMY may need tissues soon \\n\\nAbout Run BTS\\n\\nSouth Korean boy group BTS began a show called &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; on the heels of their then-just-released track &lsquo;Run&rsquo; which started off into a basic introduction and has blossomed to become a high fan favourite weekly catch-up turned occasional show  From 2015 to taking a break in late 2021 and resuming with special episodes in 2022, the show has indeed come a long way  However, it may soon have to put brakes on the run \\n\\nRun BTS Next Top Genius Part 1 Recap\\n\\nThe first part of show&#39;s latest editionshow introduced the fans to tiny games involving the BTS members who played card games and were subjected to lie detection under the scrutiny of each other&rsquo;s eyes as some fun &lsquo;cat ears&rsquo; (electroencephalograph ones)  Even with not a lot at play, the BTS members ensured their hilarity was at its peak best and spread joy with their content  &lsquo;Run BTS Next Top Genius Part 2&rsquo; was teased with more screaming, laughter and games at the expense of the seven members \\n\\nThe dice-y game\\n\\nWith a lot of points at stake, the BTS members played a long winding game of dice which required them to throw it and declare a digit making others guess if they were saying the truth  If they&rsquo;re caught, they move backwards, successful and they march right ahead  With Jungkook playing a dangerous game right from the start, the BTS members had the most fun teasing him about it as he kept going back to the start point  An honest player right from the get-go, SUGA was the first to pass through and made it past the end line in a swoop  The game turned calculative and funny at a point as some of the members including RM and Jimin kept going back and forth by continuously objecting to other people&rsquo;s declarations and poking fun at each other \\n\\nThe Yes or No betrayal\\n\\nThe fourth game was one testing the loyalties of the BTS members as they all sent out signals to each other hoping for cooperation  They were all sent to a room to ask if they&rsquo;d like to split the points with all members and had to choose yes or no  Soon after, all seven of them secretly revealed their answers and the minority would determine the winners  In tthe &lsquo;95 liners, members V and Jimin, camewho came out on top as they each picked &lsquo;No&rsquo;  The two were the top two contenders for the finals, competing in an upcoming fierce match \\n\\nRock, Paper and Scissors\\n\\nThe final game to decide the winner was laid out as the infamous &lsquo;Rock, Paper, Scissors&rsquo; which has become known for ensuring big battles in the world of K-pop  Also frequently used to decide on the most basic things, the game was played through cards and divided the team of BTS into two, with half on the side of V and the other half on Jimin&rsquo;s side  They each had three rounds to decide their 5 cards with rock, paper or scissors on them with advice from the other members  However, only the members themselves knew their original sides ensuing a lot of suspicion and chaos  While Jimin doubted those giving him suggestions, V dedicatedly followed all that was told to him  A last spurt of 10 seconds had them change up everything adding more havoc to the already crazy game  Finally, when the other members&rsquo; loyalties were revealed, SUGA managed to fool everyone by being at Jimin&rsquo;s side all the time and in fact belonging to V&rsquo;s team, meanwhile, J-Hope&rsquo;s changing alliances finally found a home with the other 1995 star &nbsp;\\n\\nJimin was announced as the final winner of this edition of &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; and was awarded a trophy and other funny elements that the other members were not in the least bit jealous about &nbsp;\\n\\nIs Run BTS ending?\\n\\nJungkook made a fleeting comment towards the end of the episode as he said, &ldquo;Yes, like this  As of today, &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;  It&rsquo;s ending &rdquo; making the rest of the six laugh in shock as they stopped him  They confirmed that one more episode was left to shoot  The captions confirmed that another filming schedule for &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; before Jin&rsquo;s enlistment, the last one for a while, has indeed been planned &nbsp;\\n\\nWhile it may not mean that the show is coming to an end, it is indeed true that Jin may not be a part of the other upcoming &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; episodes if the group decides to continue shooting after his enlistment which took place on December 13, though highly unlikely  This means that after another edition, &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; may end up taking another break (if they&rsquo;ve not shot for more than one episode after this) until the military services of all other members are also complete and they reconvene sometime in 2025 as previously revealed \\nEjUUTh8eqboStay updated with the latest Hallyu news on: Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat\\n\\n&nbsp;\\nALSO READ: BTS' Jin's The Astronaut reaches 100 million streams: Artist says I'll be back in pre-enlistment video\": 40.58417508417508},\n",

intention to flee to South Korea and meet their favourite K-pop group BTS  During this extensive police search, a diary was found of the 13 year old girl which revealed their plans \\n\\nPolice stated to CNN in an interview that the diary included details such as train timetables and details of another friend of theirs who was also planning to run away with the two teenage girls  In this handwritten diary, they also prepared a plan to reach Islamabad by train  The police interviewed this other friend  They also claimed that the duo even wanted to take their relative Naufil with them but Naufil refused to take this plan \\n\\nA forensic examination was also conducted by the police for their deleted browsing data and WhatsApp chats, which further confirmed that they left their homes to go to South Korea and join the K-pop sensation BTS  The girls carried out thorough online research on South Korea, including things to do, types of clothes to wear, things to avoid, and so on  The duo Googled these things and made their plans accordingly \\n\\nAfter finding this information, the police aggressively started searching for the duo, whose location was traced to Lahore, which is 1200 kilometres from their home  The girls travelled to Lahore by train  The police in charge of the investigation later found that the two teenage girls were in police custody in Lahore \\n\\nThe duo were found by a patrolling constable at a railway station  They seemed in miserable condition and were trying to disguise themselves as boys so they got overlooked  When the duo were initially probed, they complained about the indifferent attitude of their parents and wanted to live life on their own terms  The girls are in safe and sound condition as of now \\n\\nA cultural journalist who spoke to CNN about this case mentioned that the decisions and risks taken by girls were not so surprising since &lsquo;stans&rsquo; are known to do anything for their idols  This is why it is important to create a safe and organized space for fan girls so that they can freely engage with each other and talk about their favourite idols rather than taking the risk of fleeing from home \\n\\nThe senior superintendent of Karachi said that they had made arrangements with the Lahore police to coordinate bringing these teenage girls back home  He further urged parents to monitor the online activities of their children in a video statement \\n\\nAbout BTS\\n\\nBTS or Bangtan Sonyeondan is one of the leading K-pop boy band sensations that have garnered immense followings at the global level  They debuted in 2013 with seven members including V, J-Hope, Suga, Jimin, Jungkook, RM, and Jin  Their fan following also referred to as ARMY, is spread across the globe, including Pakistan &nbsp;\\n\\nSince BTS&rsquo;

Who first approached whom and if any difficulties stood between them while working on the song  Taeyang held a countdown live broadcast an hour before dropping the song on THEBLACKLABEL&rsquo;s YouTube channel and delved into the details of this collaboration \\n\\nTaeyang spills about collaboration with Jimin\\n\\nOn being asked where did the idea of working with Jimin first stem from, the BIGBANG member recalled an incident on a casual night in THEBLACKLABEL studio after dinner, he was conversing with producer Teddy Park who is known for being the man behind a lot of BLACKPINK&rsquo;s superhit tracks like &lsquo;AS IF IT&#39;S YOUR LAST&rsquo;, &lsquo;DDU-DU DDU-DU&rsquo; and the girls solo tracks, and is also the co-founder of THEBLACKLABEL, which is Taeyang&rsquo;s new agency  While thinking about his upcoming projects including a solo album, the popular producer mentioned how fun it would be to have Taeyang and Jimin on one song  He added that if the two worked together, people would love it  This was also when BTS primarily did group activities and the members were not as active as solo artists &nbsp;\\n\\nTeddy Park&rsquo;s words in passing were taken seriously by the 34 year-old as the thought stuck in his mind  While he had never pondered over the possibility before, the simple mention made him think of a great collaboration that would come to fruition a couple of years later \\n\\nHow did Taeyang and Jimin meet?\\n\\nBIGBANG and BTS are two supergroups that have made themselves known globally  The members each have a massive fan following  But unfortunately they&rsquo;ve never been spotted together previously, up until 2022 when they began attending similar events and going to the same parties  Taeyang seemed to be aware of this gap in their matching schedules as he mentioned how their promotional activities had never overlapped before  Moreover, the singer had also never asked anyone to collaborate with him before this and found it difficult to come across someone he&rsquo;d like to work with \\n\\nTo his rescue, last year there were a few dinners that the BIGBANG member got invited to where he had an opportunity to meet BTS  Taeyang spoke about coming across the group&rsquo;s members one by one and eventually becoming acquainted with Jimin  Simple chats later, they ended up talking about working together some day and Taeyang asked Jimin if he&rsquo;d like for them to make music together which finally resulted in going to the studio and working on the track that is now called &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; \\n\\nTaeyang and Jimin shooting for VIBE\\n\\nThe singer also spoke about working for other promotional bits like teaser photos at the music video filming site  He added that they tried to add an older feel to the song, making them feel like a hip hop duo \\n\\nManoeuvring their different labels\\n\\nTaeyang belonged to YG Entertainment when the creation of this song first began and has since moved to its subsidiary THEBLACKLABEL following the expiration of his exclusive contract in December 2022  On the other hand, BTS member Jimin is an artist with BIGHIT MUSIC, and overall to HYBE  Moreover, it is rare for the BIGBANG members to collaborate with someone, more so outside of their own agency  So, Taeyang spoke about having to work out that bit for the song and how he as well as Jimin wished to make a great song as well as the music video for &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo;  During a recent interview with Rolling Stone, the singer talked of the BTS member taking a lot of effort for this song, which he had come to appreciate greatly \\n\\nVIBE choreography\\n\\nTaeyang and Jimin are known to be quick on their feet however the former had not worked on his dancing skills for quite some time now while the latter had a different style than what they were aiming for this song, which led the two of them to face some difficulties while learning the steps, making them wonder about the reason and if it was really a tough collection of steps \\n\\nStay updated with the latest Hallyu news on: Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat\\nALSO READ: Love for BTS: Missing teenage Pakistani girls found 1200 kms from home, ran away to meet favourite K-pop group': 36.4652076318743},\n",

Previously, only BIGBANG and 2NE1 were able to do so, once again showing NewJeans&rsquo; popularity &nbsp;\\n\\nBased on the Melon TOP100 chart on January 17th, NewJeans&#39; &#39;Ditto&#39; is number one  After its release on December 19 last year, it drew attention as it maintains the top spot in competition with the songs of prominent artists  It is also noteworthy that the unchanging top charts, including &#39;Ditto&#39;  Younha&#39;s &#39;Event Horizon&#39; and BIGBANG&#39;s&nbsp;Taeyang&#39;s &#39;VIBE&#39; (Feat  BTS&#39; Jimin) were ranked 4th and 5th, respectively \\n\\nNewJeans on Billboard Charts:&nbsp;\\n\\nLee Hwa Jeong, a researcher at NH Investment &amp; Securities, said that NewJeans is expected to enter the Billboard main single chart Hot 100 with the new song &#39;Ditto&#39; and It is a achievement after half a year of debut, and it is not a sparkling effect right after the album release  It deserves special attention  Unlike the album chart (Billboard 200), where K-pop artists frequently appear, in the case of the single chart (Hot 100), publicity indicators such as streaming, sales, and radio airplay for each song must be supported to enter  It is relatively difficult, he emphasized  For reference, considering that the starting point for BLACKPINK&rsquo;s public awareness in the US was when &#39;DDU-DU DDU-DU&#39; entered the Hot 100 in 2018, it is particularly worth paying attention to &nbsp;\\n\\nNewJeans&rsquo; Ditto:&nbsp;\\n\\nThe &#39;monster rookie&#39; NewJeans, who entered their 5th month of debut, are doing an overwhelming job  In addition to the long-term box office success of their debut songs, they are building new records by succeeding in consecutive box office hits with two of their recently released singles  NewJeans released their first single album &#39;OMG&#39; on the 2nd  This album, which contains the title song &#39;OMG&#39; and &#39;Ditto&#39;, which was released in advance last month, talks about a relationship once again in a slightly strange distance and a little unfamiliar background, showing New Jeans&#39; unique winter sensibility \\n\\nImmediately after its release, &lsquo;Ditto&rsquo; landed at No  1 on the real-time charts of Melon, Bugs, and Genie on domestic music sites, and also entered the Melon Weekly Chart at No  1  Following this, &lsquo;Ditto&rsquo; has been holding the No  1 spot on the weekly chart for three consecutive weeks  On the Spotify &#39;Daily Top Song Global&#39; chart, it ranked 19th with 3 26 million daily streams (as of December 20)  Following BTS and BLACKPINK, NewJeans is the only group with more than 3 million global daily streams \\n\\nIn particular, according to the US Billboard, NewJeans&#39; &#39;Ditto&#39; ranked 4th on the Billboard &#39;Global (excluding the US)&#39; and 8th on the &#39;Global 200&#39; on the chart dated the 14th  This is NewJeans&#39; own highest ranking record, and New Jeans became an artist who entered the top 10 of the &#39;Global 200&#39;
